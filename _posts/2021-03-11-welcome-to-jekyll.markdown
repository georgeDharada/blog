This is a blog created in order to record some of my personal opinions around technology and hands-on activities I have done. I will be delighted if it shows to be useful for somebody.
Any coding will go inside code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(test)
  puts "Hi, #{test}"
end
print_hi('George')
#=> prints 'Hi, George' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}


This blog website is make of Jekyll on github. Feel free to check it out!
